oops-

gobal data-
            accesibal for entire Program

class-
             -fundamental unit of oop
             -user defined data type
               ex- class fruit
              class class_name{
                 int data1;
                  int data2
                                },
object-
                variables of type class
                ex- mango, apple

                pointer access by= ->

constructor-
               -used to initialized an object
               -this is function which is called when an object is  created
                -same name as class name
-types-
                 1.default- no args passed
                 2.parametrised- args pass
                 3. copy-initialise an obj by existing object
destructor-
                - function is called when object is deleted
                - cannot pass any parameters
                - name -> ~( class name)

encapsulation-
                - binding of methods and variables together into a single unit call class

                - data is only accessible from the class method
                - also leads to death abstraction or hiding class call abstraction data type (ADT)


abstraction
                - enable us to display only he sciential information while hiding the implementation details

inheritance-

                a class inherits property of another class for example property from parent to child class
                 mode of inheritance
                 1 public - data and function they can be ascess  anywhere in code
                 2 .protected- accessible in own class parent class and derived class
                 3 private-
                  * single inheritance =-A->b
                 multiple inheritance-=A->   B ->c
                 hierarchical inheritance-
                 one parent many Childs
polymorphism
                  ability of object and methods to take different forms  
                  function overloading
                  define a number of functions with same function name they perform differently according to the argument passed  
 friend function     -
                    a non member function whch can acess private member of class
